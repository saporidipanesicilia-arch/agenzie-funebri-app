# Responsive Design & UI (CRITICAL)

## RULE 3 — RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Every UI component must work on:
- desktop (large screens)
- tablet
- mobile (small screens)

If a layout includes tables:
- provide a mobile alternative (cards, stacked layout, collapsible rows)

- No horizontal scrolling on mobile is allowed.
- All interactive elements must be touch-friendly.
