## RULE 4 — UI STYLE & TONE
- UI must be sober, respectful, and calm.
- No flashy animations.
- No bright or playful colors.
- No gamification.
- Design must be suitable for funeral agencies and grieving families.

## RULE 5 — DOMAIN AWARENESS
- Use funeral-domain language in code, variables, and UI labels.
- Avoid generic naming like "item", "thing", or "data".
- Always prefer explicit domain terms (funeral, deceased, grave, document).
